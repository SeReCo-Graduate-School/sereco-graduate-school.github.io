## Keynote

We are excited to announce [Stefan Borgwardt](https://lat.inf.tu-dresden.de/~stefborg/) as keynote speaker for SeReCo 2026.

**Bio:** Stefan Borgwardt is a research group leader at TU Dresden, where he is working on description logics, the complexity of logical reasoning, explainability, and automated planning. He has received multiple best paper awards at international conferences, and is very active in the organization of events for the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning community.

**Title:** Automated Planning with Ontologies 

**Abstract:** Classical planning employs first-order formulas under closed- world semantics to achieve a goal with a given set of actions from an initial state. To incorporate background knowledge into the planning process, this knowledge can be provided in the form of an ontology, for example using description logics. However, description logics and other reasoning formalisms usually employ open-world semantics for drawing conclusions. In this talk, I will report on work in a project that aims to combine classical planning with description logics in order to provide more powerful and useful modeling tools for automated planning problems.
